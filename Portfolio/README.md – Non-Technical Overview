**Age Perfect** is a friendly little tool that guesses how old someone looks from a photo—think of it as the party-guest who’s eerily good at age-guessing, but powered by AI.  
Just upload (or take) a clear, front-facing picture, tap **Predict Age**, and in under a second you’ll see an estimate that’s usually within three years of the real age [oai_citation:0‡read me file Age Perfect - Advanced Age Prediction with Ordinal Regression.docx](file-service://file-VRHntnxEHhJMJqDypHKtgx). Your image never leaves your device; nothing is stored or sent online, so privacy stays in your hands.  
The model learned from thousands of diverse faces, so it “knows” that 29 comes after 28 and before 30, giving it an edge over ordinary algorithms. Free, open source, and ready for research, photo apps, or simply satisfying curiosity!
