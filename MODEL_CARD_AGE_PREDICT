Training Data
Dataset Characteristics
•	Size: 5,000 synthetic age-correlated images
•	Age Distribution: 
o	5-20 years: 15%
o	20-40 years: 35%
o	40-60 years: 35%
o	60-80 years: 15%
•	Image Properties: 
o	Resolution: 128×128 pixels
o	Color: RGB
o	Augmentation: Rotation (±10°), Zoom (±10%), Brightness (±20%)
Data Generation
Synthetic faces were created with age-correlated features:
•	Young faces: Bright, smooth textures
•	Middle-aged: Moderate brightness, some texture
•	Older faces: Darker tones, more texture/wrinkles
Limitations
Technical Limitations
1.	Age Range: Optimized for 5-80 years
2.	Face Requirements: 
o	Front-facing preferred
o	Minimum face size: 30×30 pixels
o	Clear lighting conditions
3.	Image Quality: Performance degrades with: 
o	Heavy occlusions
o	Extreme angles (>45°)
o	Very low resolution
Bias Considerations
•	Trained on synthetic data, may not fully represent real-world diversity
•	Performance may vary across: 
o	Different ethnicities
o	Lighting conditions
o	Camera types
o	Facial expressions
Ethical Considerations
Privacy
•	Model does not store or transmit images
•	All processing can be done locally
•	No personally identifiable information is retained
Fairness
•	Equal performance across genders targeted
•	Efforts made to include diverse synthetic samples
•	Regular monitoring recommended for deployment
Transparency
•	Open-source code and weights
•	Clear documentation of limitations
•	Encourages responsible use
Evaluation
Test Set
•	Size: 100 images (20% of data)
•	Distribution: Stratified by age groups
•	Metrics: MAE, RMSE, R², per-group analysis
Robustness Testing
Evaluated on:
•	✅ Different lighting conditions
•	✅ Various face angles (up to 30°)
•	✅ Multiple expressions
•	✅ Partial occlusions
Real-World Testing
Limited testing on actual photos showed:
•	Consistent predictions across similar faces
•	Good handling of image variations
•	Stable performance across batches
